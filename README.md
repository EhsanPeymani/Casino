# Mega Project: Casino
The mega project for C# course I took 2015 on DevU.com.

The idea is to emulate a slot machine. The rules as shown in the below image. 
The possible outcome of each reel is based on the images in /Casino.Presentation/Images/

I have worked more than specified on DevU.com to experience more. For example, adding a database for the results, or styling by CSS.
